# Hovercraft!

This is a fully diy hovercraft, most of their parts are fully 3d printed, the only parts that are not is the foam chasi and the camping tarp bladder powered by a brushless motor, capable of hovering, and stearing. 

## Background 

Recently I wanted to start doing some RC stuff, I originally wante to do a drone, but my teacher gave me another challenge, do a hovercraft, the idea was simple, he give me all the suplies, motor, esc, controller batteris and unlimited use of the school machines. The catch was, I had 1 month to do it, and if i was succesfull he would let me keep it, if i wasnt I had to sort all of the mixed up resistors he had in a box, so I took the challenge (plus I get a very bad greade in the class)

Turns out he would regreat this deal because the hovercraft would work flawlessly

(Note, the propeller file is not an step because it's too heavy to upload to the repo)
